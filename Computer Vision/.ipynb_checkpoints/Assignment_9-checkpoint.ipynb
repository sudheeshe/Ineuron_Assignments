This enables us to reduce the number of parameters, which both shortens the training time and combats overfitting. Max-pooling helps in extracting low-level features like edges, points, etc. While Avg-pooling goes for smooth features. If time constraint is not a problem, then one can skip the pooling layer and use a convolutional layer to do the same."
